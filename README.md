# Overview
This repository extends the original [Energy-Based Flow Classifier](https://github.com/EnergyBasedFlowClassifier/EFC-package?tab=readme-ov-file) with the integration of the MP-SPDZ framework to enable secure multi-party computation. This modification aims to enhance privacy and security in the processing of energy-based flow data, making it suitable for sensitive applications where data confidentiality is paramount.

# Requirements
Note that MP-SPDZ requires either a Linux distribution originally released 2014 or later (glibc 2.17) or macOS High Sierra or later as well as Python 3 and basic command-line utilities.

# Installation
Follow the MP-SPDZ framework installation instructions available at [MP-SPDZ GitHub Repository](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ). Place this repo inside of Programs/Source and then run run.sh from inside the repository's folder.
